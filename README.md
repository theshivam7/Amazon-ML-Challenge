## 📊 About Amazon ML Challenge

Amazon ML Challenge is a two-stage competition where students from all engineering campuses across India get a unique opportunity to work on Amazon's dataset to bring in fresh ideas and build innovative solutions for a real-world problem statement. The top three winning teams receive pre-placement interviews (PPIs) for ML roles at Amazon along with cash prizes and certificates.

## 🎯 Problem

In this hackathon, the goal is to create a machine learning model that extracts entity values from images. This capability is crucial in fields like:

- 🏥 Healthcare
- 🛒 E-commerce
- 🚫 Content moderation

As digital marketplaces expand, many products lack detailed textual descriptions, making it essential to obtain key details directly from images. These images provide important information such as weight, volume, voltage, wattage, dimensions, and many more, which are critical for digital stores.

## 📁 Dataset
[Click Here for the Datset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UKmBZMCHfPDvLczpZrz2jJ6n0rXOrKzp?usp=drive_link)

The dataset is divided into two main files:

- **train.csv**: Contains over 310,000 image links along with metadata.
- **test.csv**: Contains over 130,000 image links along with metadata.

Each dataset has the following columns:

1. **index:** A unique identifier (ID) for the data sample
2. **image_link**: Public URL where the product image is available for download
3. **group_id**: Category code of the product
4. **entity_name:** Product entity name (e.g., "item_weight")
5. **entity_value:** Product entity value (e.g., "34 gram")
   
   *Note: For test.csv, the `entity_value` column is not present as it is the target variable.*

## 📈 Results

Our model achieved the following results:

- **F1 Score**: 0.03 (highest)
- **Rank**: 595 out of 3290+ teams

## 🎓 Conclusion 

This 4-day hackathon was our longest yet. We faced challenges, particularly with computational resources needed to process such a large volume of data. Processing the test.csv file, which involved downloading over **52 GB** of images and running them through an OCR model, took us collectively more than **20 hours**. 

Despite these obstacles, it was an invaluable experience to work on a real-world problem faced by Amazon. We are extremely grateful to Amazon for hosting such an engaging hackathon and look forward to competing again next year!
